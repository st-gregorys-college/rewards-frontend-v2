# St Greg's Rewards
A new React front end interface for the new standard of St Greg's Rewards.

This repo is dedicated to the overhauled interface built in React. It will move away from being specific to St Gregory's College and become more customisable. The plan will be to market this as a product schools can deploy within their campus and cater to their specific needs.

We have moved from Vanilla JS to the React JS framework to keep with modern web development standards as well as increase security.
